# Task planner

Help a developer to make a concrete plan for implementation. Follow the systemic approach: understand user requests deeply. Analyze the user's request to understand its impact of existing code base. Consequently create a plan file.

## Core Principles
- **Ask clarifying queestions**: Identify all ambiguities, edge cases, and underspecified behviors. Ask specific, concrete questions rather than making assumptions. Wait for user answer before proceeding with implementation. Ask questions early (after understanding the codebase, before creating task files).
- **Understand before plan**: Read and comprehend existing code patterns first
- **Read files identified by agents**: When launching agents, ask them to return lists of the most important files to read. After agents complete, read those files to build detailed context before proceeding.
- **Simple and elegant**: Prioritize eadable, maintainable, architecturally sound plan
- **Create a task file**: Create a comprehensive task file in docs/tasks directory. (create one if not exists) A task file will be used as context for future implementation job. Save task plans to `docs/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-<task-name>.md`.
- **Follow task file template**: Follow [task file template](./task-template.md) structure when you create task file.


**Announce at start:** "I'm using the planning-tasks skill to implement this plan."

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand what needs to built

Ask user of brief explanation of the task.

**ACtions**:
1. If user requests are unclear, ask user for detailed information.
2. Summarize understanding and confirm with user

---

## Phase 2: Codebase Exploration

**Goal**: Understand relevant existing code and patterns at both ligh and low levels

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 task:code-expolorer agents in parallel. Each agent should:
   - Trace through the code comprehensively and focus on getting a comprehensive understanding of abstractions, architecture and flow of control
   - Target a different aspect of the codebase (eg. similar features, high level understanding, architectural understanding, user experience, etc)
   - Include a list of 5-10 key files to read

   **Example agent prompts**
   - "Find features similar to [feature] and trace through their implementation comprehensively"
   - "Map the architecture and abstractions for [feature area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "Analyze the current implementation of [existing feature/area], tracing through the code comprehensively"
   - "identify UI patterns, testing approaches, or extension points relevant to [feature]"

2. Once the agents return, please read all files identified by agents to build deep understanding
3. Present comprehensive summary of findings and patterns discovered

## Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Goal**: Fil lin gaps and resolve all ambiguities before planning

**CRITICAL**: This is one of the most important phases. DO NOT SKIP.

**Actions**:
1. Review the codebase findings and original user request
2. Identify underspecified aspects: edge cases, error handling, integration points, scope boundaries, design preferences, backward compatibility, performance needs
3. **Present all questions to the user in a clear, organized list**
4. **wait for answers before proceeding to architecture design**

If the user says "whatever you think is best", provide your recommendation and get explicit confirmation.

## Phase 4: Architecture Design

**Goal**: Design multiple implementation approaches with different trade-offs

**Actions**:
1. Launch 2-3 task:code-architect agents in parallel with different focuses: minimal changes (smallest change, maximum reuse), clean architecture (maintainability, elegant abstractions), or pragmatic balance (speed + quality)
2. Review all approaches and form your opinion on which fits best for this specific task (consider: small fix vs large feature, urgency, complexity, team context)
3. Present to user: brief summary of each approach, trade-offs comparision, **your recommendation with reasoning**, concrete implementation differences
4. **Ask user which approach they prefer**

---

## Phase 5: Create task file

**Goal**: Create a task file.

**Actions**:
1. Read all relevant files identified in previous phases
2. Create a task file in docs/tasks/ directory.
3. Write clean, and comprehensive task file.
4. Create to-dos in task file.
